  ## Description
This is a blog site where you can view posts and comments. I built this app using:
NodeJS
Sequelize
Express-handlebars
ExpressJS
Express-session
jest
mysql2
dotenv
bcrypt

 A user can only post and comment when authenticated to the site. The authenticated user has a dashboard where posts can be created, edited and deleted. Authenticated users will be logged out automatically after 5 minutes, or if the logout button is clicked. 

## Installation
  Run "npm i"
  then create a .env file and enter your db info. 
  then log into your mysql CLI in the folder path and 
  run "source db/schema.sql;"
  quit out of that and run
  "npx nodemon server"
  

## Usage
  
You can test the deployed app here: https://enigmatic-tor-99381.herokuapp.com/
